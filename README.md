Open Source Manga reading application for IOS

## Description

This is just a manga reading app written entirely in Swift for my friends and I to use. Right now it is based around the MangaDex api, but in the future I do intend to add other manga and comic sources. This is my first time using Swift, so there is definitely room for improvement.

I have no plans to publish this on the App Store or make any kind of profit from this, it was just meant to be a way to showcase my app development skills.

Feel free to use this code any may you want.
